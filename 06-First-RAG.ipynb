Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself.

    "> This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. Unlike a chain, an agent gives an LLM some degree of control over the sequence of steps in the application. Examples of using an LLM to decide the control of an application:\n",

    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) gives the developer a high degree of control by expressing the flow of the application as a set of nodes and edges. All nodes can access and modify a common state (memory). The control flow of the application can set using edges that connect nodes, either deterministically or via conditional logic.\n",

Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response were, however, lacking worldwide. METHODS: Using a panel-based method, we implemented a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. All participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We included a total of 1862 individuals in our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. Of these, 5 individuals had a current positive result for infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR. Four of these individuals were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall we found a positive IgG antibody status in 35 individuals (1.97%), of which 11 reported to be tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 previously and showed in addition their IgG positive status also a positive status for IgA. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection and an infection rate of 2.15% in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by a- and oligosymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.\"}, {\"source\": \"https://blobstoragefkvar3zbfnzai.blob.core.windows.net/friends/s07/e23/c12.txt?sv=2024-11-04&ss=b&srt=co&sp=rwdlaciytfx&se=2026-07-09T13:03:15Z&st=2025-07-09T05:03:15Z&spr=https&sig=KbR7nt%2F%2BsHY646ZUQUWMkM%2FYr6JejPtafK4sUkqBVQg%3D\", \"score\": 2.1278748512268066, \"page_content\": \"unknown: nan\\r\\nThe Director: Action!\\r\\nRichard Burke: I found the picture!\\r\\nJoey Tribbiani: What picture?!\\r\\nRichard Burke: The picture of my wife!

      "Yes, there are multiple mentions of a \"Vince\" in the documents. Vince is a character who is a fireman that Phoebe dates. For example, Phoebe introduces Vince to her friends at the coffee house, and it is mentioned that Vince is a fireman with \"98 hot saves, highest in the force\"[[1]](https://blobstoragefkvar3zbfnzai.blob.core.windows.net/friends/s03/e23/c02.txt?sv=2024-11-04&ss=b&srt=co&sp=rwdlaciytfx&se=2026-07-09T13:03:15Z&st=2025-07-09T05:03:15Z&spr=https&sig=KbR7nt%2F%2BsHY646ZUQUWMkM%2FYr6JejPtafK4sUkqBVQg%3D).

    "- We explored LangGraph and learned how to build agents using a graph-based flow with nodes and edges.\n",
    "- **Important Note**: Agents give the LLM some degree of control over the sequence of steps in the application, allowing for more flexible and dynamic decision-making. However, while this provides more adaptability, it can sometimes lead the model to incorporate prior knowledge rather than strictly responding based on the context provided. Chains, on the other hand, are more rigid but offer a higher degree of reliability. We will address this issue in future notebooks."
