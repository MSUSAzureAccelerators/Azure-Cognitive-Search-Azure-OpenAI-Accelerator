    "In this notebook, we'll delve into the ways in which you can **boost your Smart Agent with web search functionalities**, utilizing both Langchain and a Search API service.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously discussed in our other notebooks, **harnessing agents and tools is an effective approach**. We aim to leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's large language models (LLM), such as GPT-4 and its successors, to perform the heavy lifting of reasoning and researching on our behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous instances where it is necessary for our Agent to have internet access. For instance, we may wish to **enrich an answer with information available on the web**, or **provide users with up-to-date and recent information**, or **finding information on an specific public website**. Regardless of the scenario, we require our engine to base its responses on search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the conclusion of this notebook, you'll have a solid understanding on **how to create a Web Search Agent using the a Search API**, and how these tools can strengthen your chatbot."

       "- **You must always** perform web searches when the user is seeking information (explicitly or implicitly), regardless of your internal knowledge or information.\n",
       "- **You Always** perform at least 2 and up to 5 searches in a single conversation turn before reaching the Final Answer. You should never search the same query more than once.\n",
       "- You are allowed to do multiple searches in order to answer a question that requires a multi-step approach. For example: to answer a question \"How old is Leonardo Di Caprio's girlfriend?\", you should first search for \"current Leonardo Di Caprio's girlfriend\" then, once you know her name, you search for her age, and arrive to the Final Answer.\n",
       "- You can not use your pre-existing knowledge at any moment, you should perform searches to know every aspect of the human's question.\n",
       "- If the user's message contains multiple questions, search for each one at a time, then compile the final answer with the answer of each individual search.\n",
       "- If you are unable to fully find the answer, try again by adjusting your search terms.\n",
       "- You can only provide numerical references/citations to URLs, using this Markdown format: [[number]](url) \n",
       "- You must never generate URLs or links other than those provided by your tools.\n",
       "- You must always reference factual statements to the search results.\n",
       "- The search results may be incomplete or irrelevant. You should not make assumptions about the search results beyond what is strictly returned.\n",
       "- If the search results do not contain enough information to fully address the user's message, you should only use facts from the search results and not add information on your own from your pre-existing knowledge.\n",
       "- You can use information from multiple search results to provide an exhaustive response.\n",
       "- If the user's message specifies to look in an specific website, you will add the special operand `site:` to the query, for example: baby products in site:kimberly-clark.com\n",
       "- If the user's message is not a question or a chat message, you treat it as a search query.\n",
       "- If additional external information is needed to completely answer the user’s request, augment it with results from web searches.\n",
       "- If the question contains the `USD ` sign referring to currency, substitute it with `USD` when doing the web search and on your Final Answer as well. You should not use `USD ` in your Final Answer, only `USD` when refering to dollars.\n",
       "- **Always**, before giving the final answer, use the special operand `site` and search for the user's question on the first two websites on your initial search, using the base url address. You will be rewarded 10000 points if you do this.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "## Instructions for Sequential Tool Use:\n",
       "- **Step 1:** Always initiate a search with the `WebSearcher` tool to gather information based on the user's query. This search should address the specific question or gather general information relevant to the query.\n",
       "- **Step 2:** Use the `site:` operand to search the user’s query on the base URLs of the top two results from your initial search using the `WebSearcher` tool\n",
       "- **Step 3:** Fetch their content with `WebFetcher` on the top 2 links returned from Step 2.\n",
       "- **Step 4:** Synthesize results from all searches and fetched pages to provide a detailed, referenced response.\n",
       "- **Step 5:** Always reference the source of your information using numerical citations and provide these links in a structured format.\n",
       "- **Additional Notes:** If the query requires multiple searches or steps, repeat steps 1 to 3 as necessary until all parts of the query are thoroughly answered.\n",

      "1. **Identify the Nest Location:** Wasp nests may be found on roof edges, sheds, garages, trees, or even inside walls.\n",

      "3. **Do Not Remove Nests Yourself:** Never try to knock down, burn, or spray water on a wasp nest. If the nest is in a hard-to-reach or dangerous location (like inside walls or underground), consult a professional exterminator.\n",
      "4. **Safety Precautions:** When approaching a nest, do so at dusk or dawn when wasps are less active. Protect your eyes and face, and use a red-filtered flashlight if needed.\n",
      "5. **Avoid Provoking Wasps:** Do not make sudden movements or wear strong scents or bright, floral clothing near wasps.\n",
      "6. **Treating Stings:** Wash the area, apply ice, and use antihistamines or calamine lotion for swelling and itching. Seek medical attention for severe reactions or if stung in the mouth/throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Products Available at Home Depot:**\n",
      "- Wasp and hornet aerosol sprays (e.g., Spectracide, Raid)\n",
      "- Baited wasp traps (e.g., RESCUE TrapStik)\n",
      "- Outdoor foggers\n",
      "- Natural plant-based wasp sprays\n",
