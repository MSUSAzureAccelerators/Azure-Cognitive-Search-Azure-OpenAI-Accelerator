It is important to note that while some Chinese medicines showed potential in alleviating symptoms and supporting recovery, **no herbal remedy has been proven to cure or prevent COVID-19**. Their use should always be under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional, and not as a substitute for vaccination or evidence-based medical care.\n",

       "- **Composition:** A patented formula with ingredients like Forsythia, Honeysuckle, Ephedra, Isatis root, and others.\n",
       "- **Reported Effects:** May help relieve fever, cough, and fatigue; has some anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.\n",
       "- **Evidence:** Some clinical studies in China suggested symptom improvement, but robust international evidence is still limited.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2. **Jinhua Qinggan Granules (金花清感颗粒)**\n",
       "- **Composition:** Comprised of herbs such as Honeysuckle, Forsythia, Ephedra, and Licorice root.\n",
       "- **Reported Effects:** Used for fever, cough, and sore throat in mild cases.\n",
       "- **Evidence:** Included in Chinese national guidelines for mild COVID-19; some small studies suggest benefit for symptom relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 3. **Xuebijing Injection (血必净注射液)**\n",
       "- **Composition:** An injectable TCM preparation made from Carthamus, Paeonia, Salvia, Angelica, and Chuanxiong.\n",
       "- **Reported Effects:** Used in hospitals for severe cases to reduce inflammation and improve organ function.\n",
       "- **Evidence:** Some studies suggest it may help reduce severity in critically ill patients when used alongside standard care.\n",

       "#### 4. **Qingfei Paidu Decoction (清肺排毒汤)**\n",
       "- **Composition:** A complex formula based on four classic TCM prescriptions, containing over 20 herbs such as Ephedra, Licorice, Almond, and Gypsum.\n",
       "- **Reported Effects:** Used in China for a range of COVID-19 severities, especially in early and moderate stages.\n",
       "- **Evidence:** Some observational studies in China reported symptom improvement and lower progression to severe disease, but high-quality trials are lacking.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 5. **Huashi Baidu Formula (化湿败毒方)**\n",
       "- **Composition:** Contains herbs like Ephedra, Atractylodes, Pogostemon, and Licorice.\n",
       "- **Reported Effects:** Used for moderate to severe cases, especially with symptoms of dampness and toxin accumulation (in TCM theory).\n",
